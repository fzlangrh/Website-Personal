        <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in an internet browser. This can be aided by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and other scripting languages ​​such as JavaScript, VBScript, and PHP. Internet browsers receive HTML documents from web servers or from local storage and create documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the semantic structure of a web page and the initial cues included for the document's appearance. HTML elements are described by tags, written using square brackets.</p>

        <p>Cascading Style Sheet (abbreviated as CSS) is a style sheet language used to determine the presentation and style of documents written in markup languages ​​such as HTML and XML. CSS is one of the basic technologies of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and JavaScript.

        The name cascading comes from the priority scheme set to determine which declaration applies if more than one property declaration matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</</p>
